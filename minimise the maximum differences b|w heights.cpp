Given an array arr[] denoting heights of N towers and a positive integer K, you have to modify the height of each tower either by increasing or decreasing them by K only once. After modifying, height should be a non-negative integer. 
Find out what could be the possible minimum difference of the height of shortest and longest towers after you have modified each tower.

A slight modification of the problem can be found here.


Example 1:

Input:
K = 2, N = 4
Arr[] = {1, 5, 8, 10}
Output:
5
Explanation:
The array can be modified as 
{3, 3, 6, 8}. The difference between 
the largest and the smallest is 8-3 = 5.
Example 2:

Input:
K = 3, N = 5
Arr[] = {3, 9, 12, 16, 20}
Output:
11
Explanation:
The array can be modified as
{6, 12, 9, 13, 17}. The difference between 
the largest and the smallest is 17-6 = 11. 

Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function getMinDiff() which takes the arr[], n and k as input parameters and returns an integer denoting the minimum difference.


Expected Time Complexity: O(N*logN)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N)

Constraints
1 ≤ K ≤ 104
1 ≤ N ≤ 105
1 ≤ Arr[i] ≤ 105
